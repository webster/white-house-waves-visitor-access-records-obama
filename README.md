Visitor access records released by the Obama White House and published at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/disclosures/visitor-records - Accessed 19 Jan 2017

Files in the root directory are renamed for clarity and recompressed as bzip2, and GPG signed with checksums. For authenticity purposes, the verification folder has the original ZIP files from whitehouse.gov - again checksummed and gpg signed - with a log of curl -I and wget terminal output, and a save of the page on whitehouse.gov
